People who live an active lifestyle either have a hard time finding routes or remembering routes they have taken before. This application, enables cyclists to enter a start and end destination and have a cycle-friendly route created for them with step by step instructions.

The cyclist will also be given a weather forecast for the current day, so they can choose the best conditions to ride in.  If the cyclist enjoys the route they are able to save it and review it at a later date.
